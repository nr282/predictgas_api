# PredictGas API

PredictGas API aims to predict Natural Gas Consumption State By State using (1) professional grade weather data and (2) our own mathematical, scientific theory developed for the prediction of Natural Gas Consumption. 

 A Historical Benchmark achieves around a 9% prediction error on unseen Natural Gas Consumption reports. The Benchmark is discussed and laid out in the white paper.
 
 Our API cuts this to 4% prediction error. Our claim is that we have 5% skill.
