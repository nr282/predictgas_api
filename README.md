# PredictGas API

PredictGas API aims to predict Natural Gas Consumption State By State using (1) professional grade weather data and (2) our own mathematical, scientific theory developed for the prediction of Natural Gas Consumption. 

 A Historical Benchmark achieves around a 9% prediction error on unseen Natural Gas Consumption reports. The Benchmark is discussed and laid out in the white paper.
 
 Our API has a 4% prediction error. Our claim is that we have 9% - 4% = 5% skill. 

 This is likely more competetive in accuracy than the competitors 

# API Documentation

The API simply calculates Residential Consumption of Natural Gas on a state-by-state basis. The API returns values in the MMCF. The API is based around: (1) a professonal weather data provider and (2) EIA Natural Gas Consumption Reports found for example here for California:
